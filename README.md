# Twinbridge Client

### Client side of the twinbridge project

Forked from https://github.com/furest/tbClient for fixes and improvements.

/!\ Make sure bin/includes/config.py is complete ! The client will not work without it. /!\

Make sure to copy the contents of the ca.key and the server certificate received by the administrator of tbServer in the client.ovpn template file.

Place that file in the bin directory.
