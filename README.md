# Twinbridge Client

### Client side of the twinbridge project

Forked from https://github.com/furest/tbClient for fixes and improvements.

/!\ Make sure bin/includes/config.py is complete ! The client will not work without it. /!\

/!\ Fill in the IP and login credentials in the revert-vms-login.ps1 script. This is necessary for the program to revert the VMs to their base snapshot /!\

Make sure to copy the contents of the ca.key and the server certificate received by the administrator of tbServer in the client.ovpn template file.

Place that file in the bin directory.
